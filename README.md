# Applications in time-series econometrics
This repo includes replication files for the Appendix charts. 

## Monte Carlo
The first set of charts is on Monte Carlo simulations for simulated AR(1) and MA(1) series. 
It features comparison across different sample sizes, different autoregressive parameters and different number of replications.

## (Moving) Block Bootstrap
The second set is on Moving Block Boostraping for simulated AR(1) and MA(1) series.
It features comparison across different sample sizes, different autoregressive parameters and different number of draws.


## Ridge, Lasso, PCA and PLS
The last set of charts includes ridge regression, lasso regression, PCA, and PLS. The corresponding charts feature the evolution of the
estimated beta coefficients and the extracted factors, respectively.

Dataset: For this exercise the FRED-QD dataset for the US is used, excluding some variables
